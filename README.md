the base namespace contains 6 mods that define the features of the beta 2 6.2 version of line rider:
- [base.label](label.md)
- [base.gridver](gridver.md)
- [base.scnline](scnline.md)
- [base.simline](simline.md)
- [base.startline](startline.md)
- [base.startoffset](startoffset.md)

any implementation supporting all 6 of these may load any track written by beta 6.2, provided the track's .sol is converted to .lrb

the specs in this repo are drafts (version 0) and can't be expected to have the correct format as the draft changes, the versions will only be bumped to 1 once they are finalized.
